# game-theoretic-deep-learning

This project aims to investigate the emergent strategies of neural networks which are trained - with an evolutionary approach - to play a board game. It involves a simple 'capture-the-flag' style game played by two opponents, with the main feature being that the scoring rules can be changed to add increasing game-theoretic complexity.
